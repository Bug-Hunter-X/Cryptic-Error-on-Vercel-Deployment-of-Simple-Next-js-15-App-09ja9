# Cryptic Error on Vercel Deployment of Simple Next.js 15 App

This repository demonstrates a strange and difficult-to-debug error encountered when deploying a seemingly simple Next.js 15 application to Vercel.  The application itself is minimal, rendering only "Hello World", yet deployment fails with an unclear error message.

## Issue

The primary issue is the lack of helpful information in the error message provided by Vercel.  This makes identifying the root cause of the failure extremely challenging.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd cryptic-vercel-error`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Attempt to deploy to Vercel (you'll need a Vercel account).

## Potential Causes (and why they are unlikely in this case)

* **Missing Dependencies:**  The application has no dependencies, making this unlikely.
* **Incorrect Configuration:** The application's configuration is extremely simple, also making this unlikely.
* **Build Process Issue:** The build process seems straightforward, yet it still fails.
* **Vercel Platform Glitch:** This is the most likely cause given the cryptic and unhelpful nature of the error, pointing to a potential bug on Vercel's side.
