```javascript
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Hello World</div>
  );
}
```
The solution in this case might involve:
1. **Creating a new Vercel project:**  Sometimes, a fresh start eliminates underlying issues on the Vercel platform.
2. **Testing with a different Next.js version:**  Although Next.js 15 was used, testing with a slightly older or newer version might help determine if this is a version-specific issue.
3. **Checking Vercel's status page:**  Vercel might be experiencing temporary outages or issues. It's important to check Vercel's status page for any reported problems that could be affecting deployments.
4. **Contacting Vercel Support:** If all else fails, reaching out to Vercel support to report the unusual error and provide them with the repository details for investigation is the most effective way to resolve the deployment problem.
